        <p>- Hack Club : Boba Drops -</p>
        <p>- Hack Club : Boba Drops is a Hack Club program that supports student hackers by covering the cost of boba when they meet up to code together. The goal is to encourage in-person collaboration, community building, and consistent project work. Students organize a coding session, work on technical projects, and submit proof of the meetup to receive reimbursement for boba drinks. -</p>
